Merry Christmas 2020: Christmas and New Year is a holiday season around the world. Itâ€™s a time for fun and entertainment but make sure you wear your mask and avoid big circles. At Christmas time in the middle of the epidemic, it is important that we communicate and tell each other that no one is there. Today there are many ways to stay safe and to have friends and family. Before Christmas and New Year, meet and greet friends online, post wishes on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp or any other way you choose. 2021 needs human solidarity if we are to address the global and economic problems of the world. Christmas trees are high and fairy tales spread joy and hope in homes before the new year
