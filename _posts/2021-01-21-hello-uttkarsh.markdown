description: 'Merry Christmas 2020: Christmas and New Year is a holiday season around
  the world. Itâ€™s a time for fun and entertainment but make sure you wear your mask
  and avoid big circles. At Christmas time in the middle of the epidemic, it is important
  that we communicate and tell each other that no one is there. Today there are many
  ways to stay safe and to have friends and family. Before Christmas and New Year,
  meet and greet friends online, post wishes on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp or any
  other way you choose. 2021 needs human solidarity if we are to address the global
  and economic problems of the world. Christmas trees are high and fairy tales spread
  joy and hope in homes before the new year'
